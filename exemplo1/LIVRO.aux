The mRNA sequence is shown from nucleotide 586 (codon 196) in exon 9 to nucleotide 810 (codon 270) in exon 10 with nucleotide 1 defined as the A of the AUG/ATG translational start codon. The splicing of introns between exon 9 and 10 removed the first G of a five-G sequence in the parental cDNA, providing four Gs from nucleotide c.697â€“700, whereas the proband mutant \textit  {COL1A1} mRNA only contained a 3-G sequence. This c.700delG genotype induced a frameshift mutation in the proband and her mother. (A) Wild-type \textit  {COL1A1} mRNA. (B) Proband \textit  {COL1A1} mRNA with the 700delG variant.\relax }}{7}}
